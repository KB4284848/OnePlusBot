# OnePlusBot
OnePlus bot for the /r/OnePlus discord.

# Getting started
To have an instance to try it out, you can use `docker-compose`.
Put your token in seed_data.sql in the two places and the server id of the server you want to connect in the line with `server_id`.
Execute `docker-compose up --build`. With this you should have a running instance of the bot.

With that you should have a running instance, there are some errors right now (which need an improvement), but the instance should be running and functional.
